# Your First PWA

This is demo code for [auto-script](https://github.com/eee-c/auto-type), a VS Code extension.

The code is taken from [Your First Progressive App](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/) codelab, from Google.

The auto-type scripts are stored in the `.auto-type` directory. There are scripts for each step in the codelab. The scripts can be found at:

* [step 1 script](https://github.com/eee-c/your-first-pwa/tree/step1/.auto-type)
* [step 2 script](https://github.com/eee-c/your-first-pwa/tree/step2/.auto-type)
* [step 3 script](https://github.com/eee-c/your-first-pwa/tree/step3/.auto-type)
* [step 4 script](https://github.com/eee-c/your-first-pwa/tree/step4/.auto-type)
